    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "The **BitTorrent client** can be used in two ways: as a command-line script or imported as a package into other Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running as a Script\n",
    "When run as a script, you can pass command-line arguments. The entry point is `__main__.py`. The `destination` argument is optional and defaults to the current directory from which the client is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "python -m torrentula --torr <your-torrent.torrent> --dest <download-directory>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Command Line Arguments\n",
    ">>> python -m torrentula --torr tests/fixtures/debian-mac.torrent --help\n",
    "A BitTorrent client to download a .torrent file from its distributed swarm.\n",
    "\n",
    "options:\n",
    "  -h, --help           show this help message and exit\n",
    "  --torr, -t TORR      The relative path to a .torrent file (from the current directory).\n",
    "  --dest, -d DEST      The relative path of the destination directory where the downloaded file will be saved (default: current directory).\n",
    "  --port, -p PORT      The port that the client will listen for incoming connections on.\n",
    "  --endgame ENDGAME    The progress percentage that will activate endgame mode.\n",
    "  --loopback LOOPBACK  Comma-separated list of ports to connect to via loopback.\n",
    "  --nat, -n            Request a public IP and port for NAT traversal.\n",
    "  --clean, -c          Remove all downloaded artifacts for the given torrent file in the destination directory before starting download.\n",
    "  --internal           Do not connect to any peers provided by the tracker.\n",
    "  --seed, -s           Seed the torrent file after acquiring the complete file.\n",
    "  --tui                View download progress in a textual user interface.\n",
    "  --verbose, -v        Include logs with console output (stderr).\n",
    "  --debug              Set logger to debug level (most verbose).\n",
    "  --info               Set logger to info level.\n",
    "  --rarest             Set strategy to rarest first.\n",
    "  --random             Set strategy to random piece assignment.\n",
    "  --propshare          Set strategy to proportional share.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Commands\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -m torrentula --torr tests/fixtures/debian-mac.torrent\n",
    "python -m torrentula --torr tests/fixtures/FreeBSD.torrent --port 2000 --seed --tui --clean\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importing as a Package\n",
    "You can also import the package programmatically into other Python code. In this case, __main__.py is ignored, and __init__.py is invoked, exposing the functions imported inside __init__.py to the scope of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import torrentula\n",
    "torrentula.download_torrent(<your-torrent.torrent>, <download-directory>)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This method allows for integration of the torrent client directly within Python applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Development and Testing\n",
    "The library tests can be automatically discovered and ran by the unittests library. Example torrents for testing are in the 'fixtures' directory.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "python -m unittest discover -s tests\n",

    "# Features/Extra Credit\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Features \n",
    "- Communicate with the tracker (with support for compact format)\n",
    "- Download a file from other instances of your client\n",
    "- Download a file from official BitTorrent clients \n",
    "\n",
    "### Extra Credit/Additional Features \n",
    "\n",
    "**Scrape From Tracker** \n",
    "- Our implementation includes a scrape request method for the tracker, although used at the moment, it can provide useful statistics on the status of the swarm.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intuitive command line information regarding download**\n",
    "- The project features an info line in the command line that contains information\n",
    "- Timer \n",
    "- Peers \n",
    "- Connected peers \n",
    "- Percent of completion \n",
    "- Download speed \n",
    "- Upload speed \n",
    "\n",
    "- Ex: Downloading: debian-mac-12.8.0-amd64-netinst.iso | Time: 0:47 | Peers: 77 (48 connected) | Completed: 58.01% (380.11 MB of 659.55 MB) | Download Speed: 4.80 MB/s | Upload Speed: 0.00 MB/s  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Stop and resume downloading**\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the situation where someone stops the download the client will store a temporary bitfield map and save the file with a .part file extension so if the download is started again it will pull the bitfield map and pick up where it left off.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rarest First**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Upon selecting the target piece for each peer we look at each of their bitfields and determine a list ranking the pieces by who has them. After this we we pick one of the top 60 rarest pieces to assign to each peer to request. The code for this extra credit can be found in the strategy.py file. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Extensive Terminal Display** \n",
    "\n",
    "- The UI has a download bitmap showing which have pieces have been downloaded as well as detailed information regarding each peer. The information for each peer includes (IP, Port, Type, Status, Upload (KB), Downloaded (KB)), Download Speed, Upload Speed, Piece Assigned, and Number of Requests. \n",
    "![Example Image](images/UIiii.png)<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**End Game** \n",
    "\n",
    "- Additions (commit c9906012):\n",
    "- In send_requests in client, if we find that our target piece is completed, cancel all of our outgoing requests (happens without endgame mode too, which is fine)\n",
    "- If we have downloaded over ENDGAME_CUTOFF_PERCENT, turn endgame on (set booleans in file and piece objects)\n",
    "- Improvements to receiving a duplicate block (we should throw it away) both in peer and piece\n",
    "- In endgame mode, in get_next_request, in piece, we ignore the limit of one request per offset and instead take from a set of offsets that we refresh when empty. This ensures an even distribution in requests for blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "**UDP Tracker** \n",
    "\n",
    "- Support to contact a UDP tracker. There is a command line argument where the user can specify the tracker preference to be UDP. If there is a UDP tracker in the annonce-list of the torrent file, the client will connect to it and get peer information. We implemented sending the connect and announce requests, as well as the timeout/retransmission after 15 * 2 ^(# of retries) seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "**HTTPS Tracker**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Support to contact a HTTPS tracker. We used an ssl python library to wrap the socket, before sending the HTTP get request. Similar to UDP tracker support, users can specify preference to contact an HTTPS tracker instead with command line arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Additional Command line arguments** \n",
    "\n",
    "- ‘--clean' to remove download artifacts related to the requested torrent download \n",
    "- '--dest' to specify a destination directory\n",
    "- ‘--nat’\n"

    "# Design and Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "When designing and implementing the project we decided to use Python as it was a language everyone was comfortable with and we decided to follow an OOP style to make debugging and navigating the project easier later down the road. This also made it easier to divide the work up. Another major design choice we made was to avoid using threads. Some of us did not have a lot of experience with threads and felt it would make the project more complicated and possibly more error-prone. We also decided to implement extra features to make our lives easier such as detailed logging, and an intuitive UI. \n",
    "![Example Image](images/layout.png)<br>\n",
    "The following diagram is a sketch of the main components of the project. At the top, we have the main class which takes in the necessary information, validates it, initializes the client, and begins the download. The client class is the brains of the project as it is responsible for calling anything related to completing the file. The client file contains the main loop for our algorithm. This algorithm looks like the following:<br> \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "while not self.file.complete():\n",
    "    add_peers()\n",
    "    accept_peers()\n",
    "    receive_messages()\n",
    "    cleanup_peers()\n",
    "    update_bitfield()    \n",
    "    send_haves(completed_pieces)\n",
    "    send_requests()\n",
    "    send_requests_reponses_back()\n",
    "    send_keepalives()\n",
    "    send_interested()\n",
    "    if datetime.now() - epoch_start_time >= timedelta(EPOCH_DURATION_SECS):\n",
    "        establish_new_epoch()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The client begins by talking to the tracker class which is responsible for handling all data and messages being sent and received from the tracker. The client will also initialize the file object at this time which is responsible for holding and handling any data associated with the file being downloaded. It will keep track of a temporary bitfield to send to peers and will remain in case of a stop and resume download. It will hold onto a list of pieces. Each piece class will hold the necessary information associated with the piece just as length, index, hash, and the necessary data structures for the blocks. Anytime a block is received it will be sent to the piece class to be saved in a data structure holding the block data with its offset and length. After this has been initiated it can join the swarm and upon doing so will receive its list of peers which will each be stored in a peer class. The peer class is responsible for tracking a single other peer and the connection between the client and them. Any message being sent to that peer will be sent from here and any incoming message will be processed by the correct peer it came from. Lastly, the client initializes the Strategy class which is responsible for picking peers to unchoke and for finding the rarest piece to ask for. The main loop of the client class which will accept, send, and establish the proper epoch will continue until the download is either complete or stopped.\n",
